Introducing chlorine gas at constant volume C. Introducing an inert gas at constant pressure D. Increasing the volume of the container E. Introducing PCl5 at constant volume,"C. Adding inert gas at constant pressure increases the overall volume, reduces the concentration of all reactants, changing the partial pressure. The system tries to undo that change and to increase the concentration goes in the direction where moles increase, which is the forward direction in this case. D.

Likewise, in comparison to secondary halides, primary alkyl halides tend to be more reactive towards SN2 substitution reaction. This is mainly a result of the steric hindrance and the electron donating effect of alkyl groups. These properties also cause an increase of electron destiny on the carbon attached to halogen further making it less electrophilic. This basically explains the order P>R>Q If we look at compound S, we will find a phenyl group and a carbonyl group. Interestingly, both these groups are electron-withdrawing groups. Because of this characteristic, the electron density on the carbon attached to the chlorine atom decreases.

Looking at these processes, in each of the steps either the pressure of the volume is constant. So using this law it is pretty easy to figure out what happens.
