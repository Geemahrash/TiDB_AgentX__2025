What is TiDB?,TiDB is an open-source distributed SQL database that supports Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability and strong consistency.,tidb database sql distributed htap
How does B+ tree indexing work?,B+ tree indexing is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches in logarithmic time. All data records are stored in leaf nodes while internal nodes only store key values. This structure optimizes for range queries and disk access patterns.,b+ tree index algorithm database search
What are the advantages of TiDB over traditional databases?,TiDB offers horizontal scalability without sharding, high availability with distributed architecture, MySQL compatibility, ACID compliance, and HTAP capabilities that allow running analytical workloads on transactional data without ETL.,tidb advantages benefits traditional database
How can I connect to TiDB Cloud?,You can connect to TiDB Cloud using standard MySQL clients and connectors. First, obtain your connection details from the TiDB Cloud console including host, port, username, and password. Then use these credentials with your preferred MySQL client or driver.,tidb cloud connection mysql client
What is the difference between TiDB and MySQL?,While TiDB is MySQL compatible, it differs in being a distributed database designed for horizontal scaling. TiDB automatically shards data, provides distributed transactions, and offers HTAP capabilities, while MySQL is primarily a single-instance database that requires manual sharding for scaling.,tidb mysql difference comparison
How does TiDB handle distributed transactions?,TiDB uses a two-phase commit protocol with optimizations to ensure ACID compliance across distributed nodes. It leverages the Percolator transaction model and optimistic concurrency control to maintain consistency while allowing high throughput.,tidb distributed transactions acid percolator
What storage engines does TiDB use?,TiDB uses TiKV (a distributed key-value storage engine) for row data and TiFlash (a columnar storage engine) for analytical processing. This separation allows for HTAP workloads with optimized performance for both transactional and analytical queries.,tikv tiflash storage engine
How can I optimize TiDB performance?,To optimize TiDB performance: 1) Design proper indexes, 2) Use appropriate shard keys, 3) Configure memory and CPU resources adequately, 4) Tune GC settings, 5) Optimize SQL queries, 6) Use prepared statements, and 7) Consider workload isolation with resource control.,tidb performance optimization tuning
What is TiDB's architecture?,TiDB's architecture consists of stateless TiDB servers handling SQL processing, TiKV storage nodes for distributed transactional data storage, PD (Placement Driver) for cluster management and metadata coordination, and optionally TiFlash nodes for columnar storage and analytics.,tidb architecture components
How does TiDB ensure high availability?,TiDB ensures high availability through data replication (typically 3 replicas), automated failover, region balancing, and leader election. The PD component monitors cluster health and automatically handles node failures by promoting replicas and redistributing data.,tidb high availability ha failover
